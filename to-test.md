### General

- wWe've completely refactored the way information was synchronized between your site and WordPress.com, thus ensuring every module uses information that's up to date. As a result, every module communicating with WordPress.com should be tested. Information should match the settings on your site, and no warnings, errors, or notices should be displayed when using any of the modules.
